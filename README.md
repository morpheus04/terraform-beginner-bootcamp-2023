# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project will utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, e.g. `0.1.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI


### Considerations with th Terraform CLI Changes
The Terraform installation has changed due to gpg keyring changes. So the we needed to refer to latest CLI install instructions

[How to Check OS Verision in Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-os-version-in-linux-command-line/)

Example of checking OS Version:

```sh
$ cat /etc/os-release 
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues, we notice that bash scripts were a considerable amount of code. So we decided to create a bash script to install Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allows us an easier way to debug and execute Terraform CLI install manually


#### Shebang

A Shebang (pronounced She-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpret the script e.g. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommended the use of `#!/bin/env bash` for:

- portability of different distributions
- search for user's PATH for bash executable



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)



#### Linux Permissions Considerations

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

alternatively:

```sh
chmod 0744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### GitHub Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

Careful when using **init** as it will not run if restarting existing workspace

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks


### Working with Env Vars

List out all Environmment Variables (Env Vars) using `env` command

Filter out specific env vars using the **grep** syntax e.g. `env | grep AWS`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

Set using `export HELLO='world`

Unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```
Within a bash script we can set env without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```

#### Printing Vars

We can print an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want to Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`

#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in thoes workspaces.

You can also set en vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-senstive env vars.


### AWS CLI Installation

AWS CLI is installed for the project via the bash script [`./bin/install_aws_cli`](./bin/install_aws_cli)


[Getting Started Install (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
[AWS CLI Env Vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

We can check if our AWS credentials is configured correctly by running the following AWS CLI command:
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If it is succesful you should see a json payload return that looks like this:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AIEAVUO15ZPVHJ5WIJ5KR",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/terraform-beginner-bootcamp"
}
```

We'll need to generate AWS CLI credits from IAM User in order to the user AWS CLI.

## Terraform Basics

### Terraform Registry

Terraform sources their providers and modules from the Terraform registry which located at [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/)

- **Providers** is an interface to APIs that will allow to create resources in terraform.
- **Modules** are a way to make large amount of terraform code modular, portable and sharable.

[Randon Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random)

### Terraform Console

We can see a list of all the Terrform commands by simply typing `terraform`


#### Terraform Init

At the start of a new terraform project we will run `terraform init` to download the binaries for the terraform providers that we'll use in this project.

#### Terraform Plan

`terraform plan`

This will generate out a changeset, about the state of our infrastructure and what will be changed.

We can output this changeset ie. "plan" to be passed to an apply, but often you can just ignore outputting.

#### Terraform Apply

`terraform apply`

This will run a plan and pass the changeset to be execute by terraform. Apply should prompt yes or no.

If we want to automatically approve an apply we can provide the auto approve flag eg. `terraform apply --auto-approve`

### Terraform Lock Files

`.terraform.lock.hcl` contains the locked versioning for the providers or modulues that should be used with this project.

The Terraform Lock File **should be committed** to your Version Control System (VSC) eg. Github

### Terraform State Files

`.terraform.tfstate` contain information about the current state of your infrastructure.

This file **should not be commited** to your VCS.

This file can contain sensentive data.

If you lose this file, you lose knowning the state of your infrastructure.

`.terraform.tfstate.backup` is the previous state file state.

### Terraform Directory

`.terraform` directory contains binaries of terraform providers.
